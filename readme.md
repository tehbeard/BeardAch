BeardAch provides a powerful achievements framework for Bukkit.

This framework allows server owners to quickly create custom achievements for their servers,
that can range from simple mine x blocks ones (Req. BeardStat) to complicated achievement chains.

Support is also provided for coding custom Triggers and Rewards, allowing developers to expand
BeardAch to their needs.
