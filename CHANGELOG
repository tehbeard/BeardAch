##Banana Split
* Support for BeardStat 0.6 and up
  * Will probably when loaded with 0.5 and below, DO NOT DO THIS.
  * stat and statwithin support domain and world entries.
    * By default, will use the "default" domain and world * (all worlds)
    * Counter reward now uses the "beardach" domain, and the world is set based on players current world, any triggers based on it will need to be changed.
* Team trigger
* When using the BROADCAST display method, send the achievement description to the achievee.
* Add support for loading multiple json files, to simplify management of large amounts of achievements (in a standard deployment, they should be under plugins/BeardAch/config and end in .json)
* Tweak to build system to prevent problems.
##Apricot
* Moved achievement configuration storage to JSON
  * Should automatically convert old config to new
  * No more nasty yaml strings of death, 
  * Makes it easier to keep forwards and backwards compatibility, allowing triggers/rewards to be improved over time without it killing configs.
* Added a fancy html based achievement editor (beta)
  * Tested in firefox and Chrome on windows
  * If you use I.E  and complain, I hope you step on a lego.
  * Held under plugins/BeardAch/editor
  * settings.js is generated by the plugin, and describes
    how to make the UI's for editing the triggers/rewards
  * Support for addon triggers/rewards built into this
* Broke compatability with old addons
  * Breakage needed to enforce changeover
  * Triggers and rewards should use @Expose on fields that
    should be saved. @EditorField is used by the plugin to generate the UI, look to the built in triggers/rewards for examples, and contact me if needs be :)
* Removed help file generation, didn't really work
* Fortify the sql data adapter to try and stop connection loss
causing crashing errors.
* Add command check trigger, this is fired from the commandpreprocessevent (i.e. Before the command is processed)
* New build system for plugin, less work for me to add triggers
  and rewards

* Fix boot lock up bug in achievement checker.
